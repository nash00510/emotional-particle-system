# Emotional Particle System
### A program that displays 6 emotions graphically using a particle system.

This project was an Assignment for COMPX221 (Programming for creative industrys). Our brief was to create a program that displayed 6 different emotions visually; Anger, Fear, Joy, Love, Sadness and Surprise.

There are 6 big particles and many small particles. The big particles are each emotion and are draggable. They have a sort of gravitational radius, if a small particle is within this radius, its movement is affected to express its emotion.

This program was created using Processing (https://processing.org/).
